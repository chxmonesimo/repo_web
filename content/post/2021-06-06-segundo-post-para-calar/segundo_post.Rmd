## Why Blog?

When I first started learning to code in R, Google was (and still is) my go-to when I had a question. It didn't take long to realize that this generally brought me to one of two destinations - StackOverflow or [Insert Name]'s blog. So, I created a StackOverflow account and decided to start my own data science blog. However, I didn't quite know where to start and spent most of 2016 scoping different platforms. While I won't go into all the details of this process, the cliff notes are as follows:

+ Tried Jekyll. The installation and dependencies (e.g. Ruby) were more complicated than I wanted and I was hoping for a more direct integration of R into the workflow
+ Created a website with RMarkdown. Getting setup was a breeze but found the blogging capability to be lacking

Enter [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), the new brainchild of Yihui Xi. Though still in the early beta stage, blogdown checked all the boxes I was looking for. [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is a R package that combines the ease of [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) with the flexibility and customizability of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Hugo is an open-source static site generator similar to Jekyll, which means it builds your website once rather than each time a user visits it by taking all files within the website's directory and rendering a complete website.
